# Initial plan for NEA

* I am creating a program capable of parsing, displaying and calculating paths using openly available map data
* I will probably use HTML/JS for this as these have well-documented canvas functions for drawing and will be accessible to a range of devices. I have also used them before in the past.
* I will be using OpenStreetMap data for Cambridgeshire, available in XML format

## Things to do
- [ ] Research map data format - how it is organised and how we can parse it
- [ ] Research path finding algorithms, I know a tiny bit of graph theory so will have to research this alongside path finding algorithms
- [ ] Design data structures
- [ ] Create UI
- [ ] Plan algorithm
- [ ] Create code for plotting
- [ ] Test code for plotting to verify it works
- [ ] Create code for path finding
- [ ] Test code for path finding to verify it works
